# About the building blocks of IC's and Transistors

> Some diods and you have a transistor. Some transitors, capacitors and resistrors and you have an IC

To undestand this understand Ohm's Law
- V = I * R
- and the Current is I = V/R || I = P/R if P is known

The Diode:
===
- Barebone building blocks of (IC's)
- Conduct electrical signal in one direction (forward direction) through the conductor
- Conducts using [pn-junction](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P%E2%80%93n_junction)

Forward Voltage (FV):
- voltage where the diod starts to fully conduct within it's rating

Types:
- Signal Diods (medium Current and forward volta)
- Power Diods (Higher Current, Larger FV)
- Light Emitting Diods (LED)
- & more variants like Schottky diods...

Common Materials(Conductors):
- Silicon (Si) (most commonly used)
- Germanium (Ge) (Seldomly used; Takes lower input voltage and sometimes also has advantages over Si)

The Transistor:
===
- Amplifying or **switching** electrical signals (current power in an EC)
- I want my input current to go up
- I want to control my input current to flow in a certain way
- If you have a few they can at least switch or amplify the current wich is still amazing
- If you have thousands or billions they can to magic (Memory, CPU's)
- 3 Terminal/Pin Devices
- have 2 diods
- Rely on semiconductors

Marterials (Semiconductors):
- We need some doping element to create the following special semiconductor materials:
  - [p-type](https://circuitglobe.com/p-type-semiconductor.html) (a lot of holes, less amount of electrons, lower conductivity, nh >> ne)
  - [n-type](https://circuitglobe.com/n-type-semiconductor.html) (lesser holes, a lot of electrons, higher conductivity ne >> nh)
  - The [difference](https://circuitglobe.com/difference-between-p-type-and-n-type-semiconductor.html) is in the amount if holes vs electrons

Bipolar junction transistor (BJT):

- Ways of operation:
  - Saturation -- Free flow from C to E like a [SC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Short_circuit)
  - Cut-off -- Turn of flow like an [OC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-circuit_voltage)
  - Active -- Proportional Current form C to E like flow into B (Usually what you want)
  - Reverse-Active -- Proportional from Base flow from E to C (Not really nice)

- Terminals:
  - Emitter (E, n-type, diode)
  - Collector (C, n-type, diode)
  - Base (B, p-type)

- Emitter:
  - Suply majority of charge
  - Forward Bias Connection (to be able to emit)

- Collector:
  - Collect majority of charge
  - Reverse Bias Connection (to be able to collect)

Base:
  - input circuit to E as forward bias
  - output circuit to C as reverse bias

Flow of BJT(NPN,PNP) Transistors:
```
  NPN Transistor:
           E   C
   Flow to E \ /
              |
             Base(B)
  
  ------------------------------
  PNP Transistor:
           E   C
   Flow to B \ /
              |
             Base(B)
```

Metal-Oxide Field-effect transistor (MOSFET)

Field Effect?
- Field effect means the electric field that is generated by leveraging
  electric current in the middle pin of the transistor (Gate). Thats where
  we can control the flow of our tiny little electrons(-)

- Terminals
  - Source (S, n-type)
  - Drain (D, n-type)
  - Gate (G, p-type, Channel Region)

- Types:
  - p-channel MOSFET (source is p, gate is n, drain is p)
  - n-channel MOSGET (source is n, gate is p, drain is n)

Flow of MOSFET

             Gate(G)
```

IC (Integrated Circuit):
===
- bunch of interconnected transistors, resistors or capacitors put together into one chip
- ??
